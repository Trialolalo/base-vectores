Acknowledging the popularity of the line in Hawaii, Bullmark began importing their toys with some startling differentiation from their domestic, Japanese counterparts.The primary variation between standard and Hawaii Bullmarks lies in the paint scheme, which is often radically different from the Japanese vinyls. In addition, the header cards were made specifically for distribution outside of Japan, and sport English text. The Hawaiian version of Ghidorah was released around 1974. The color is similar to the original's except that it has silver eyes and has some metalic green spray.",
